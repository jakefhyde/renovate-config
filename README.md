# renovate-config

This repository contains the centralized Renovate preset (`default.json`) and the reusable workflow used to run Renovate (`.github/workflows/renovate.yml`)

## Used branches

- `main` (aka develop), this is where the development happens and changes are introduced. This branch is kept up-to-date with Renovate pointing to its own preset.
- `release`, this is the branch where all the repositories point to. After testing our changes in `main`, we promote `main` to `release`.
